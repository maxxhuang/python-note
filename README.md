I took note of what I have learned when I was working on my last Python project.

## Installation
Running the notebook requires Python 3.10+. 
Preferably prepare a virtual environment for running the notebook.
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
```bash
$ pip install jupyter

# go to the directory containing the notebook file (python-note.ipynb)
$ jupyter notebook
or
$ jupyter lab
```
